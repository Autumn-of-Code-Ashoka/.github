# autumnofcode 
Autumn of Code is our version of a month-long celebration of open-source software. It’s a time where the tech community comes together to embrace the spirit of collaboration in coding, by contributing to open-source projects. Whether you’re a seasoned coder or just starting out, Autumn of Code is the perfect chance to dive into the world of open-source and make a positive impact!

During Autumn of Code, you’ll encounter two distinct project tiers that will be open for contribution, each aimed at enhancing our campus. Additionally, we’ve crafted an extra tier tailored for those eager to take their first steps into the world of collaborative, public programming, while exploring fundamental coding concepts.

Autumn of Code, or AOC, will also feature talks, code sprints, bug sharing sessions, helpdesks, fun night events, and so much more which will continue from now till the end of October.

AOC, organized by the CS Societies at Ashoka: CS Soc and WiCS, will also feature events in collaboration with–but not limited to–the Mphasis Digital Makerspace and IEEE! The best part? It’s open to all majors, so everyone can participate and explore the world of open source and coding.
